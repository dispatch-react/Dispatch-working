Please be advised that this framework does not include the npm packages.

1. First run "npm install".
2. Then run "npm start" to start watchify. Watchify will monitor all your files and compile them to public/js/main.js. 
Since all the files are imported into main.jsx you do not have to do anything else at this stage.

jQuery and Bootstrap are included in the files so as to have complete control over the project.
